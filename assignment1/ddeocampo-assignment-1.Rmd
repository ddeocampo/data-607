## Getting The Data
This dataset is coming from the agaricus-lepiota.data file.

```{r getdata}
mushroom_data <- read.csv("agaricus-lepiota.data",
                          header = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
