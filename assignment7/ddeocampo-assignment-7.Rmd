```{r setup}
library(XML)
library(RCurl)
library(xml2)
library(rjson)
```

## Reading HTML
```{r readhtml}
importbookhtml <- readHTMLTable("books.html", header = F)
importbookhtml
```

## Reading XML
```{r readxml}
importbookxml <- xmlParse("books.xml")
bookxml <- xmlToList(importbookxml)
bookxml
```

## Reading JSON
```{r readjson}
importbookjson <- fromJSON(file = "books.json")
importbookjson
```

The 3 data frames are not identical. Reading from XML and json would yield similar data frames with a list of chars, but from html, it is returning as a vector.
